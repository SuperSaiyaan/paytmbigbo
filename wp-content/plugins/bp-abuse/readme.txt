Plugin Name: BuddyPress Abuse Department
Plugin URI: http://www.icoder.com/wordpress/buddypress/bp-abuse/
Description: Abuse and moderation for BuddyPress communities.
Requires at least: WP 2.9.2, BP 1.2.1
Tested up to: WP 2.9.2, BP 1.2.3

1) Make sure you have the BuddyPress plugin (http://buddypress.org) activated.

2) Upload the bp-abuse folder into the wp-content/plugins folder of WordPress

3) Activate the BP-Abuse plugin


The BP-Abuse adds a "report abuse" link to every posted content in the site,
so members can easily report contents to help admin moderates content.

Admin can receive a notification email on an abuse report.

The BP-Abuse has an auto-moderate feature. So after a specified number
of reports (5 by default) from different members were places on a posted content,
the content would be auto-moderated (automatically deleted) without the admin interaction.

Admins can then see all the reported contents in an organized table in the WP backend.
Admin has options to delete the content that is waiting moderation or mark it as non abusive.

Another table shows top 10 troublemaker members, how many posts from them have been moderated.
So admins can easily find them and delete their account if needed.

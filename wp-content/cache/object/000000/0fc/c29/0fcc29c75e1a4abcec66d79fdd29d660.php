<span style="font-weight: 400;">With a reach of over 10 crore customers on Paytm, you must stand out from the crowd. Customers love great offers especially if they come in the form of Freebies and Combo offers.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Hereâ€™s a little insight into selling Combos &amp; Freebies on Paytm to help give the extra edge your business needs.</span>
<h3><b>Combos</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">As a Paytm seller, you are you can sell a set of goods as a single unit. The advantages of this can be:</span>
<ul>
	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A lower combined price that seems more attractive to the customer.</span></li>
	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Itâ€™s a great way of increasing sales by offering best offers. </span></li>
	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can sell goods from your inventory faster</span></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Letâ€™s take an example here to better understand this. Here you see a combos of T-shirts and how the price is shown after discount. To a buyer it makes more sense to buy this as heâ€™s getting it for cheaper than him buying one. Saving 40% on buying 2 t-shirts seems better to the customer. After all who doesnâ€™t like a good steal. </span>

<h3>What you need to keep in mind if you want to sell Combos</h3>
<ul>
	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The MRP should be the total sum of the individual product in the combo. For example, in the above image, the MRP of the combo of 2 t-shirts is Rs. 1,000 and the MRP of each individual t-shirt is Rs. 500.</span></li>
	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the products in the combo do not carry any individual MRP, then you are required to pack them as a single unit. This single unit should have a valid MRP label representing the MRP of the combo.</span></li>
	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In all other cases, you need to mention the individual MRPs of the products included in the combo product description on the product listing page. You also need to ensure that each product carries the individual MRP label.</span></li>
</ul>
<h3>Freebies</h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Freebies are exciting for customers. As a seller you need to understand, Freebies are different from combos. In the case of a Freebie, the price charged to the customer, is only for the base product. A â€˜freeâ€™ component is added to the base product as a Freebie. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">A classic example of a Freebie is shown below. Letâ€™s say the price of one t-shirt is Rs. 300, when you are offering the second t-shirt free the t-shirt price will be shown as Rs. 300 and the second t-shirt will be the freebie.</span>

<h3>What you need to keep in mind if you want to sell Freebies</h3>
<ul>
	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The MRP of the Freebie listing should </span><b>not</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> include the MRP of the freebie. </span></li>
	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is recommended that you mention the individual MRPs of the base product as well as the freebie in the product description.</span></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Please understand that violation of the above mentioned guidelines is considered as a malpractice on your part and Paytm reserves all rights to penalize you for any violation of the same and you could be subject to severe penal and legal action.</span>

As per the new Paytm policy, items that are returned by the customer will be sent to Paytmâ€™s Returns Processing Center (RPC).

A Returns Processing Center is a physical hub where the merchandise returned by the customer is brought for quality check before it is dispatched further to the merchant.

The products will be quality checked against the customer's complaint and if the customer's complaint is validated, the product will be sent back to the seller and debit would be marked to the seller's account.

If Paytm feels that the products received at the RPC are not in a condition to be sent back to the seller, the product will not be sent back to the seller and NO debit will be marked to the seller's account.

Paytm's decision, in either case, shall be treated as final.
<h2>Â 1.2 How do I know if my shipment will go to the RPC?</h2>
It is Paytmâ€™s prerogative to decide which shipments will go through the RPC. If your shipment is assigned to the RPC, you will get the following content in your email with â€˜Yesâ€™ mentioned under the â€˜RPC Assignedâ€™ column:

â€œ

This is to inform you that as per our logistics partnerâ€™s report, following items have been picked from the customer for return.Â Please find below summary of the picked items.
<table width="633">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td width="64"><strong>REVERSE COURIER</strong></td>
<td width="61"><strong>AWB NO</strong></td>
<td width="73"><strong>ORDER NO</strong></td>
<td width="61"><strong>ITEM ID</strong></td>
<td width="66"><strong>ITEM NAME</strong></td>
<td width="95"><strong>QUANTITY</strong></td>
<td width="75"><strong>PICKED DATE</strong></td>
<td width="117"><strong>RPC ASSIGNED</strong></td>
<td width="21"></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
&nbsp;

â€œ

If â€˜Noâ€™ is mentioned under the â€˜RPC Assignedâ€™ column, then that particular shipment will not go through the RPC. Such shipments will be sent directly to the merchantâ€™s address.

A â€˜RPC Assignedâ€™ flag will also be visible to the merchant on the seller panel if the shipment is assigned to the RPC.
<h2>1.3Â Â  How much time will be taken by the RPC for QC?</h2>
At RPC, every item will be quality checked thoroughly to validate customer complaint. The RPC will take a maximum ofÂ <strong>72Â hours</strong>Â to process the shipments.
<h2>1.4Â Â  What if my item is â€˜QC failedâ€™ at RPC?</h2>
â€˜QC failed or QC rejectedâ€™ implies that Paytm felt that the product was not in a condition to be sent back to the merchant.

If the item is QC failed at RPC, we will not send the item back to the merchant and the item will be liquidated from the RPC. The status of such items will be shown as â€˜Liquidatedâ€™ in the â€˜Returnsâ€™ tab of Seller panel. No debit will be marked to the merchant in such cases.

The following communication shall go to the merchant in this case:

â€œ

We have found that the following product that was returned by the customer, was not in a condition to be sent back to you and hence is being retained by Paytm. No debit will be marked to your account for this product.

<h2>1.5Â Â  What if my item is â€˜QC passedâ€™ at RPC?</h2>
â€˜QC passed or QC acceptedâ€™ implies that the customerâ€™s complaint was genuine. Such shipments will be sent back to the seller. Shipping details of such shipments will be communicated to the seller once the shipments are dispatched from the RPC.

A debit will be marked to the sellerâ€™s account in such cases once the shipment is delivered.

The following communication shall go to the merchant in this case:

â€œ

The following items returned by the customer have been quality checked at RPC. We have found that the customer's complaint was valid and hence the product is being sent back to you.

<h2>1.6Â Â  What if I want my shipment to be assigned to an RPC?</h2>
The prerogative of mapping a merchant to the RPC/sending a shipment to the RPC shall lie with Paytm. A merchant can raise a request to process his/her shipments through the RPC via merchant helpdesk (email: <a href="mailto:merchant.helpdesk@paytm.com">merchant.helpdesk@paytm.com</a>) but Paytmâ€™s decision in this regard shall be final.
<h2>1.7Â Â  When will I receive my product if it is QC passed?</h2>
Once the Item has passed the quality check and has been shipped from RPC, the merchant will get a notification about the shipments dispatched through an email. The merchant should receive such item(s) at their warehouse within 21 days of reverse pickup from the customer.

<h3 dir="ltr"><span class="il">Combos</span> &amp; <span class="il">Freebies</span> Boost Sales</h3>
With a reach of over 10 crore customers on Paytm, you must stand out from the crowd. Customers love great offers especially if they come in the form of <span class="il">Freebies</span> and <span class="il">Combo</span> offers.
<p dir="ltr">Hereâ€™s a little insight into selling <span class="il">Combos</span> &amp; <span class="il">Freebies</span> on Paytm to help give the extra edge your business needs.</p>

<h3>Combos</h3>
As a Paytm seller, you are you can sell a set of goods as a single unit. The advantages of this can be:
<ul>
	<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">A lower combined price that seems more attractive to the customer.</p>
</li>
	<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Itâ€™s a great way of increasing sales by offering best offers.</p>
</li>
	<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">You can sell goods from your inventory faster</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">Letâ€™s take an example here to better understand this. Here you see a <span class="il">combos</span> of T-shirts and how the price is shown after discount. To a buyer it makes more sense to buy this as heâ€™s getting it for cheaper than him buying one. Saving 40% on buying 2 t-shirts seems better to the customer. After all who doesnâ€™t like a good steal.</p>

<p dir="ltr"><strong>What you need to keep in mind if you want to sell <span class="il">Combos</span></strong></p>

<ul>
	<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">The MRP should be the total sum of the individual product in the <span class="il">combo</span>. For example, in the above image, the MRP of the <span class="il">combo</span> of 2 t-shirts is Rs. 1,000 and the MRP of each individual t-shirt is Rs. 500.</p>
</li>
	<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">If the products in the <span class="il">combo</span> do not carry any individual MRP, then you are required to pack them as a single unit. This single unit should have a valid MRP label representing the MRP of the <span class="il">combo</span>.</p>
</li>
	<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">In all other cases, you need to mention the individual MRPs of the products included in the <span class="il">combo</span> product description on the product listing page. You also need to ensure that each product carries the individual MRP label.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 dir="ltr"><span class="il">Freebies</span></h3>
<p dir="ltr"><span class="il">Freebies</span> are exciting for customers. As a seller you need to understand, <span class="il">Freebies</span> are different from <span class="il">combos</span>. In the case of a <span class="il">Freebie</span>, the price charged to the customer, is only for the base product. A â€˜freeâ€™ component is added to the base product as a <span class="il">Freebie</span>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">A classic example of a <span class="il">Freebie</span> is shown below. Letâ€™s say the price of one t-shirt is Rs. 300, when you are offering the second t-shirt free the t-shirt price will be shown as Rs. 300 and the second t-shirt will be the <span class="il">freebie</span>.</p>

<p dir="ltr"></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>What you need to keep in mind if you want to sell <span class="il">Freebies</span></strong></p>

<ul>
	<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">The MRP of the <span class="il">Freebie</span> listing should not include the MRP of the <span class="il">freebie</span>.</p>
</li>
	<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">It is recommended that you mention the individual MRPs of the base product as well as the <span class="il">freebie</span> in the product description.</p>

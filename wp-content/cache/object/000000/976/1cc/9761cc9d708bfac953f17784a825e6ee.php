Thanks for writing to us!

A well-maintained stock is a surefire way to manage deliverable during tight situations. Start doing this months before a festival starts or a sale initiates. Plan, manage and execute could be a spot-on hack for you. You can do that by proper planning on maintaining a buffer, for sure. 

Also, considering your situation of limited workforce, we want you to consider some of our  service providers who are in stock and ship domain. Check out some of them here:

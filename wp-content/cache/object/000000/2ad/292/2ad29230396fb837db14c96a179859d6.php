Review Team is all about reviewing the processed catalog from the Merchant Onboarding Team. If itâ€™s A-Okay then itâ€™s processed further to the Catalog Processing Team. However, just in case, if there are some possible discrepancies in some filter values and other inputs in the catalog then the same is escalated to the Merchant Communication Team and the issues are swiftly sorted with an effective communication with the merchant.

After all the issues are rectified and sorted, the Catalog Processing Team (CPT) takes up the charge for making all the final calls. CPT creates the catalog abiding by all the preset guidelines and images are mapped. The Image Team takes care for ensuring that mapped images are in an appropriate size and dimensions.Right after this, if the catalog features crawling type then the same is sent to the Crawling Team that takes care of the crawling needs and creates the catalog.

After all the mapped images are re-sized as per the set guidelines and data has been crawled then the catalog is piped for the quality check. The QC Team then checks input data as per the standards. After this quality check the catalog is forwarded to the Web QC Team, which uploads the catalog on our panel and checks the cataloging on the replica of our production. After that when everything is in the right place, the catalog is migrated and then it is Live on our website.";s:10:"post_title";s:49:"Adding Bulk Products â€“ Catalogue Offline Upload";s:12:"post_excerpt";s:0:"";s:11:"post_status";s:7:"publish";s:14:"comment_status";s:6:"closed";s:11:"ping_status";s:6:"closed";s:13:"post_password";s:0:"";s:9:"post_name";s:45:"adding-bulk-products-catalogue-offline-upload";s:7:"to_ping";s:0:"";s:6:"pinged";s:0:"";s:13:"post_modified";s:19:"2015-11-17 19:21:45";s:17:"post_modified_gmt";s:19:"2015-11-17 19:21:45";s:21:"post_content_filtered";s:0:"";s:11:"post_parent";i:0;s:4:"guid";s:41:"http://localhost/paytmbigbo/?page_id=1334";s:10:"menu_order";i:0;s:9:"post_type";s:4:"page";s:14:"post_mime_type";s:0:"";s:13:"comment_count";s:1:"0";s:6:"filter";s:3:"raw";}}

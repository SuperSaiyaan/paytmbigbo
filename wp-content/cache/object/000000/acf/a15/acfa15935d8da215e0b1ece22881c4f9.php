I received 50-60 orders per day on Paytm as I planned and had good stock with me. But, I have a problem that the number of workers in my factory is limited and sometimes satisfying order requests seems difficult.

Can some one help me find a solution here? I am curious to know some good tips to manage my stock for the next sale as well.

Thanks!";s:10:"post_title";s:16:"stock management";s:12:"post_excerpt";s:0:"";s:11:"post_status";s:7:"publish";s:14:"comment_status";s:6:"closed";s:11:"ping_status";s:6:"closed";s:13:"post_password";s:0:"";s:9:"post_name";s:16:"stock-management";s:7:"to_ping";s:0:"";s:6:"pinged";s:0:"";s:13:"post_modified";s:19:"2016-01-13 16:53:16";s:17:"post_modified_gmt";s:19:"2016-01-13 11:23:16";s:21:"post_content_filtered";s:0:"";s:11:"post_parent";i:750;s:4:"guid";s:57:"http://localhost/paytmbigbo/forum/topic/stock-management/";s:10:"menu_order";i:0;s:9:"post_type";s:5:"topic";s:14:"post_mime_type";s:0:"";s:13:"comment_count";s:1:"0";s:6:"filter";s:3:"raw";}}
